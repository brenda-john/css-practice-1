        <h3>Makes 1 large boule</h3>
            <p>This bread has a nutty flavor and intense chew; it makes toast thatâ€™s a wholesome meal unto itself. To ensure you have fresh bread on time, count back three nights from the day you want to bake. If you want bread on Saturday, start Wednesday night. Bake it anytime Saturday. This is part of BA's Best, a collection of our essential recipes.</p>
